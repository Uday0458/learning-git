Basic Concepts of Git
1. Repository
A repository is a storage space where your projectâ€™s files and the history of their changes are stored. A Git repository can exist locally on your machine or as a remote repository on a server like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

2. Commit
A commit is like a snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time. Each commit records changes to the repo that describes what was changed and why and why. Commits from the history of your project.
